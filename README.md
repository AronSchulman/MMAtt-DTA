## User instructions

To use the models, you need to download them from Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10589695. In the root of the repository, create a directory called `models`. Place the downloaded `interaction_score_models` and `pchembl_models` directories in the `models` directory.

The relevant script for users is `src/main_user_predict.py`.

Requirements:
```
pandas
numpy
torch
rdkit
```
To make predictions for your drug-target pairs, you need to provide a `.csv` file with the following four columns:
* smiles
* uniprot_id
* protein_class
* model_type

Values in the `protein_class` column should be one or more from the following: `[enzyme, epigenetic_regulator, gpcr, ion_channel, kinase, nuclear_receptor, transporter]`.
Values in the `model_type` column should be either `pchembl` or `interaction_score` depending on your preferred label type.
See the `example_input.csv` for reference.

Use the following command to run the script:
```
python main_user_predict.py -i /path/to/user_input.csv
```
You need to provide the path to your input file after the `-i` flag.

All predictions are mean values generated by an ensemble of five models. It is recommended to run the prediction on a GPU-equipped machine.

After execution, the script produces a `model_output_predictions.csv` file in the same directory as the executed script. The file is identical to the input file, with the addition of a `prediction` column that contains the pairwise affinity predictions in pchembl or interaction score format, depending on your specification.

### Limitations

For the protein descriptors, the user is limited to the pre-calculated values found in `descriptor_data`. If the user supplies an unavailable protein, the descriptor values are filled with zeros. This is not a problem for the subclass label. However, for sequence-based and Zernike descriptors, this may negatively impact the prediction accuracy. The available proteins can be found in the `descriptor_data` directory.

If you wish for the addition of descriptors for your proteins, do be in touch with us.

## Reproducing thesis results

For reproducing some of the results in the thesis, we provide the following scripts:
```
train.py
tune.py
test.py
LASSO_feature_selection.py
```
In addition to the previous requirements, these scripts require:
```
ray==2.6.3
hebo
sklearn
scipy
lifelines
matplotlib
seaborn
wandb
```

All the relevant data used for model training and testing are found in the Zenodo repository mentioned above. 
Please open an issue in case of dependency problems, bugs, and general enquiries about usage.
